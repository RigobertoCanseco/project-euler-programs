  <h1>109 Darts</h1>

  <p><strong>Problem 109</strong><br />
<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=109">https://projecteuler.net/problem=109</a></p>

<p>In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p109.png" class="dark_img" alt="" /><br /></div>
<p>The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.</p>
<p>At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.</p>
<p>There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a "doubles out" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is "bust".</p>
<p>When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a "checkout" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).</p>
<p>There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:</p>
<div class="center monospace">
<table class="center">
<tr>
<td>     </td>
<td>     </td>
<td>     </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>D3</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>D1</td><td>D2</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>S2</td><td>D2</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>D2</td><td>D1</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>S4</td><td>D1</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>S1</td><td>S1</td><td>D2</td></tr>
<tr><td>S1</td><td>T1</td><td>D1</td></tr>
<tr><td>S1</td><td>S3</td><td>D1</td></tr>
<tr><td>D1</td><td>D1</td><td>D1</td></tr>
<tr><td>D1</td><td>S2</td><td>D1</td></tr>
<tr><td>S2</td><td>S2</td><td>D1</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Note that D1 D2 is considered <b>different</b> to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the <b>same</b> as T1 S1 D1.</p>
<p>In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for example, D3 is the <b>same</b> as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.</p>
<p>Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.</p>
<p>How many distinct ways can a player checkout with a score less than 100?</p>
