  <h1>567 Reciprocal Games I</h1>

  <p><strong>Problem 567</strong><br />
<a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=567">https://projecteuler.net/problem=567</a></p>

<p>Tom has built a random generator that is connected to a row of $n$ light bulbs. Whenever the random generator is activated each of the $n$ lights is turned on with the probability of $\frac 1 2$, independently of its former state or the state of the other light bulbs.</p>

<p>While discussing with his friend Jerry how to use his generator, they invent two different games, they call the <i>reciprocal games</i>:<br />
Both games consist of $n$ turns. Each turn is started by choosing a number $k$ randomly between (and including) $1$ and $n$, with equal probability of $\frac 1 n$ for each number, while the possible win for that turn is the reciprocal of $k$, that is $\frac 1 k$.</p>

<p>In game A, Tom activates his random generator once in each turn. If the number of lights turned on is the same as the previously chosen number $k$, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing for that turn. Jerry's expected win after playing the total game A consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_A(n)$. For example $J_A(6)=0.39505208$, rounded to 8 decimal places.</p>

<p>For each turn in game B, after $k$ has been randomly selected, Tom keeps reactivating his random generator until exactly $k$ lights are turned on. After that Jerry takes over and reactivates the random generator until he, too, has generated a pattern with exactly $k$ lights turned on. If this pattern is identical to Tom's last pattern, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing. Jerry's expected win after the total game B consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_B(n)$. For example $J_B(6)=0.43333333$, rounded to 8 decimal places.</p>

<p>Let $\displaystyle S(m)=\sum_{n=1}^m (J_A(n)+J_B(n))$. For example $S(6)=7.58932292$, rounded to 8 decimal places.</p>

<p>Find S(123456789), rounded to 8 decimal places.</p>
