**Problem 02**  
[https://projecteuler.net/problem=02](https://projecteuler.net/problem=02)

<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p>
<p class="center">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

**Code**  `python`

```python

def fibonacci():
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    tmp = 1
    f = 0
    for i in range(10):
        tmp = f + tmp  
        f = tmp
        print(f)
```
